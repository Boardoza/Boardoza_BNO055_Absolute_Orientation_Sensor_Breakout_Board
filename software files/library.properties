sentence=Library for Boardoza BNO055 Absolute Orientation Sensor
paragraph=This library provides an easy‑to‑use API for interfacing with the Boardoza BNO055 9‑axis absolute orientation sensor breakout. It handles all I²C communication, returns high‑precision orientation (Euler angles/quaternion), acceleration, gyroscope, and magnetometer data, and includes built‑in error checking and sensor calibration routines. With minimal dependencies and clear example sketches, it’s designed to help you integrate the BNO055 quickly into any Arduino or PlatformIO project.
